              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>This is the story about how I &#34;<strong><em>discovered</em></strong>&#34;
              the worlds most famous mark up language,
              and how it is inspiring me to become a web engineer.

              <p>It was just another day like any other, during the Corona 
              (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk018SNQ69nutV4ZVANxswspCaTLKFA:1586579568447&q=covid+19&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiN6Na8xd_oAhVjUt8KHfHEB0QQBSgAegQIHBAl&biw=1517&bih=640">
              <u><strong>Covid 19</strong></u></a>) Pandemic took the world by storm. 
                There was not much going on at the time, in terms of work, and facebook, 
                along with other social media platforms was more active than usual. I had earlier 
                received several friend requests, and while browsing through, I came across something 
                that has changed my life forever
                It was a free html course being offered by pirple.com. Instantly my interest was peaked
                and i clicked on the link.  i started watching the course introduction video and as they say, 
                the rest was history.  i became captivated by what i was seeing and hearing and decided i was 
                going to enrole and become proficient at it aand now i am giving it my all.
              </p>
              <p>So far it has been a very interesting and excited experience. i have learnt, and is learning so 
                much. 
                It wont be an easy journey, but i am working to become a web developer and make this a profitable
                venture.  The secret  is to do as much reserch as possible, practise as mush aas posssible to 
                beecome the best
                i can.  My greatest joy will be to create a page that someone can view and be aken a back . Until 
                then, its work and more work...
